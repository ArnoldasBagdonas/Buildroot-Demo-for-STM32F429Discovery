    bool "Example2: Button-controlled LED with c-periphery"
    help
      This package provides a C application example using the c-periphery
      library to demonstrate GPIO input and output on embedded hardware.

      The program configures one GPIO line as input (e.g., connected to the
      STM32F429 Discovery board's user button) and another GPIO line as output
      (e.g., connected to the red LED). It continuously reads the button state
      and reflects it directly on the LED: the LED turns ON when the button is
      pressed and OFF otherwise.

      The loop runs until the user presses any key in the terminal.
