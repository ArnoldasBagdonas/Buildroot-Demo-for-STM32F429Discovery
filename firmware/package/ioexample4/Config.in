    bool "Example4: SPI Temperature Read from I3G4250D using c-periphery"
    help
      This package provides a C application example using the c-periphery
      library to demonstrate reading the temperature register from the
      ST I3G4250D gyroscope over SPI.

      The program opens the specified SPI device (e.g., /dev/spidev5.0),
      enables the sensor by writing to CTRL_REG1, then reads the OUT_TEMP
      register (0x26) and prints the raw and signed temperature value to stdout.

      The chip select (CS) line is configured via Device Tree using cs-gpios
      and is automatically handled by the Linux SPI driver.
