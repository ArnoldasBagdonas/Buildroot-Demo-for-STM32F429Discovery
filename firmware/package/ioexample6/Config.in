    help
      This package provides a simple utility demonstrating the usage of
      the Linux PWM sysfs interface on an STM32F4-based board.

      It enables PWM output on chip0, channel10 (TIM3_CH1, PB4) and interactively
      adjusts the duty cycle in steps (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%) while waiting
      for user input between changes.

      The example shows:
        - Opening and configuring a PWM channel
        - Setting frequency and duty cycle
        - Enabling/disabling PWM output
        - Basic user interaction for testing LED brightness or signal levels
