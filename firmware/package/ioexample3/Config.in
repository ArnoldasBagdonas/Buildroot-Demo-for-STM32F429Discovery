    bool "Example3: I2C Bus Scanner using c-periphery"
    help
      This package provides a C application example using the c-periphery
      library to demonstrate scanning the I2C bus for connected devices.

      The program opens a specified I2C bus (e.g., /dev/i2c-2) and attempts
      zero-length transfers to all valid 7-bit I2C addresses (0x03 to 0x77),
      printing detected device addresses to stdout.

      This is useful for debugging or discovering devices on the I2C bus.
