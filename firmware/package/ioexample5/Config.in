    bool "Example5: RCC Frequency Reader"
    help
      This package provides a simple utility that reads the STM32F4 RCC
      (Reset and Clock Control) registers directly from `/dev/mem` to
      detect and display the current system clock (SYSCLK) frequency.
      
      It demonstrates low-level hardware register mapping and direct
      memory access on STM32 microcontrollers running Linux.
