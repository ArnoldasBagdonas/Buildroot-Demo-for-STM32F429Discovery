    bool "Example6: Serial Interactive Demo (UART communication)"
    help
      This package provides a simple utility demonstrating the usage of
      the Linux serial interface on an STM32F4-based board.

      It opens a specified serial port (default: /dev/ttySTM1) configured
      for 115200 8N1, no flow control, and allows interactive user input
      from the terminal.

      The example shows:
        - Opening and configuring a serial port
        - Sending messages typed by the user
        - Handling empty input to exit gracefully
        - Basic interaction for testing UART communication
